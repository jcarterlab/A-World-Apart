# A-World-Apart

This project examines recent changes in the interconnectedness of the latest 300,000 Democratic/Republican and Tory/Labour Twitter followers in the US and UK. Like the apartheid-era South African society depicted in A World Apart, the US appears to be characterized by a high degree of political polarisation in the form of self-assigned echo chambers (i.e. they are more likely to be following only one party).
